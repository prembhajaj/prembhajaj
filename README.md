## What I've Been Up To 💼

### At Binghamton University - SUNY
**Research Assistant – Data Science & Analytics**  
*Sep 2024 – Present*  
I'm working on some pretty cool projects:
- Fine-tuning large language models (think BERT and GPT-3.5) on hundreds of multimodal patient records to boost cancer imaging diagnosis accuracy by 12% 🎯.
- Engineering features using PCA and optimizing SVM classifiers to hit high accuracy rates while reducing false positives 📈.
- Using PySpark to process hundreds of thousands of genomic samples, making data harmonization a breeze for clinical research 🔄.
- Running statistical analyses to unearth key biomarkers that could shape future treatments 🔍.

### My Time at LTIMindtree Ltd. in Mumbai
**Senior Software Engineer – Data Engineering**  
*Nov 2021 – Jan 2024*  
I dove deep into data engineering and machine learning:
- Developed text summaries using Hugging Face models, speeding up issue prioritization by 50% ⚡.
- Scaled AWS EMR workflows to process over 10M records daily and significantly cut runtimes ⏱️.
- Built a serverless ML monitoring system that slashed manual reporting from 8 hours a week to just half an hour 📊.
- Enhanced data pipelines with Spark to boost throughput and feature engineering capabilities 🚀.

**Graduate Engineer Trainee**  
*Jul 2021 – Nov 2021*  
- Developed Python-based ML microservices on Azure Functions, reducing deployment costs by 40% 💡.
- Integrated Azure tools to enhance scaling and security within CI/CD pipelines 🔒.

### Early Adventures at Peregrine PR Pvt Ltd.
**Web Development Intern**  
*Jun 2019 – Aug 2019*  
I got my start by:
- Building a timesheet application with React, Flask, and SQL that saved managers time and streamlined billing ⏳.
- Training an NLP-powered chatbot to answer FAQs with impressive accuracy 🤖.
- Assisting with third-party API integrations to boost website functionality and user engagement 🌐.

## Projects & Passions 🚀

I love taking on projects that challenge me and help me grow. Here are a few highlights:

- **Employee Timesheet and Billing Cost Calculator:**  
  A handy web app using React JS and Python Flask that helps employees log work, managers approve submissions, and clients review project costs.

- **Group Chat and Large-File Transfer Application:**  
  Built with Python's Socket and GUI libraries, this app supports real-time chatting and file transfers up to 2GB 💬📁.

- **Facial Image Generation for Suspect Identification:**  
  Trained a TensorFlow-based DCGAN on over 200K images to generate high-resolution facial images, achieving an impressive Fréchet Inception Distance score and published in Springer ICSES 2021 🖼️✨.

- **Comprehensive Study of Failed Machine Learning Applications:**  
  A research project employing a 3C (Consolidation, Classification, Case Studies) approach, culminating in a co-authored chapter in a Taylor & Francis ML journal 📚.

- **Forest Cover Classification and Clustering:**  
  Leveraged PCA and SVM (with GridSearchCV) to classify forest cover data with high accuracy, and applied K-Means clustering to validate the results 🌲📊.

- **Gene Mutation and RNAseq Data Analysis:**  
  Processed and analyzed data from over 500 NSCLC patient records to study gene expression and survival outcomes 🧬.

- **Social Media Sentiment Analysis - Reddit and 4chan:**  
  Developed a sentiment scoring pipeline with Spark NLP and Logistic Regression, deployed on AWS EMR to analyze over 100K stock market-related posts 📈💬.

- **Virtual Chemistry Lab:**  
  A web-based simulation of 25 chemistry experiments that even led to a published paper in an international journal (IRJET) 🔬.
